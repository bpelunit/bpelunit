/**
 * A receive asynchronous activity is intended to receive a single incoming transmission which
 * contains a SOAP body (a normal message, or a SOAP fault).
 * 
 * An asynchronous receive must always signal an "OK" back to the client (unless a severe server
 * configuration error occurred). The specification does NOT allow to send back meaningful SOAP
 * Faults.
 * 
 * Receive Async can be used inside an asynchronous send/receive, receive/send, or receive only
 * block. There are two constructors to accomodate these usages; one for directly initializing the
 * activiy as a child of a parent track, and one for initializing the activity as a child of another
 * (asynchronous two way) activity.

		 * 
		 * There are differing interpretations of how HTTP is to be used when performing one-way
		 * operations.
		 * 
		 * R2714 For one-way operations, an INSTANCE MUST NOT return a HTTP response that contains a
		 * SOAP envelope. Specifically, the HTTP response entity-body must be empty.
		 * 
		 * R2750 A CONSUMER MUST ignore a SOAP response carried in a response from a one-way
		 * operation.
		 * 
		 * R2727 For one-way operations, a CONSUMER MUST NOT interpret a successful HTTP response
		 * status code (i.e., 2xx) to mean the message is valid or that the receiver would process
		 * it.
		 * 
		 * One-way operations do not produce SOAP responses. Therefore, the Profile prohibits
		 * sending a SOAP envelope in response to a one-way operation. This means that transmission
		 * of one-way operations can not result in processing level responses or errors.
